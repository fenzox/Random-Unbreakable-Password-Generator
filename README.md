# Random-Unbreakable-Password-Generator
This program implements the random function in Java to produce a strong password that will take hundred of years to break via bruteforce

This program consists of alphanumeric and punctuations ( abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890!@#$%^&* ) where it randomizes the alphabets if the function produces an alphabetic variable. If you only want to produce alphanumerics, remove line 10 and uncomment line 12.
