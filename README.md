# Random-Unbreakable-Password-Generator
This program implements the random function in Java to produce a strong password that will take hundred of years to break via bruteforce

This program randomly grabs variable from all alphanumeric and punctuations ( abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890!@#$%^&* ). In the case of an alphabet, it produces a random upper or lower case. 

If you only want to produce alphanumerics, remove line 10 and uncomment line 12.
